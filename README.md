# gitclj

A Clojure library designed to provide an interface to Gitlab and
Github. I had to clone all my repositories from Gitlab and I didn't
notice that I had participation in more than 70 repositories. No way.. Let's build something.

## Usage

You need to export your TOKEN_KEY as a environment variable:

``` shell
export apikey=<YOUR-API-KEY>
```

Help o/

``` shell
$ lein run -a
This is a CLI application to handle some necessities in Gitlab/Github.

Usage: lein run [options] action

Options:
-g --gitlab ACTION ARGUMENT

Actions:
  groups                    List all groups in your GitLab
  projects <group-id>       List all projects inside a gitlab group
  clone-all <directory>     Clone all your repositories inside the <directory>

Please, contribute to improve the functionalitites =]
```

My groups:

``` shell
$ lein run -g groups

|     :id |                    :name |                                         :url |
